You are a small white square and you must fly to avoid the rectangles that are out to get you!

This game requires SDL 1.2 and a C compiler. It is optimised for low-resolution screens.

Currently this is nothing more than a proof of concept that resembles the physics of Flappy Bird, but without any graphical assets. It was made in 4 hours and 30 minutes.

Everything's under the GPL version 2.
